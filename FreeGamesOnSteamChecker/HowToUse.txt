launch app
the app should create a LastCheckedGames.txt if one doesnt exist
it sends a request to the steam link that looks for games in special offers priced at 0.00$/£/euro
it checks if the LastCheckedGames.txt has the same games as the games in the special offers
if there are not matches it prints out the differences (prints out new free games) 
else it just closes
