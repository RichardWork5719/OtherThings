-you can type the word "debug" and it will show you ALL the countries that currently have 10pm

-and typing the word "loop" will make it refresh every time you press enter 
until you type: "quit" or "exit" or "close" or "stop"
or just disable the loop by typing "loop" again
-if you want to refresh only once you can just press the spacebar and then enter again and it will refresh

-you can combine the "debug" and "loop" too

-you can type "clear" to have your console clear after every refresh (which means previous text will be wiped before showing you the newly refreshed text)
combinable with "debug" and "loop"

-in the top right(on a 1920x1080 monitor) you will now be able to see: 
- current date n time
- how long left till 10mp for you
- app usage time (this usage time will only update and save whenever you refresh or **close the app by built-in means**

a .txt file will show up in the same place/folder as the app called "10pmUseTimer.txt"
in that .txt file is the number of seconds youve been using your app for
the app reads that and does the math for you by formulating it into     days : hours : minutes : seconds     in the "App usage time"
and then also saves the new usage time into that .txt file every time you refresh (or close it by built-in means)
