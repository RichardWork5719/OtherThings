-This is a website I made for me and my friends based on an inside joke we have (more details are in the "about" page)
-index.html is the 'main' page for now (there are plans for a proper main page in the future)
from index.html all the other pages are be accessible through hyperlinks as if navigating through a normal website

-In index.html there is only one fully finished 'chapter' as a proof of concept
more chapters will be worked on after more work on other website aspects/features
-It also seems that the comic 'chapter' only seems to be the correct size for firefox browsers
I haven't tested it on chrome browsers until very recently so this size problem is a fairly new discovery and a solution will be thought of after more work on other website aspects/features

Disclaimer:
-The comic page images are not made by me
-the "Merch" and "Crowbar-chan is not useless (on Webtoons)" hyperlinks lead outside of the project to things I did not work on
but I left them there since they are intended to be there
