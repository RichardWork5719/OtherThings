        <li><p>a crowbar made out of safety glass, so when you try to use it, it shatters into a thousand pieces</p></li>
        <li><p>a taser crowbar that tases the holder, but in a way where the muscles of the holder are unable to let go of the crowbar<br>(comes with a charging stand... so basically has to be permanently left on the stand, because there is no way to pick it up without getting tased and fully discharging the crowbar again)</p></li>
        <li><p>a sandstone crowbar that is delivered in a box of sand (when the box is attempted to be opened, the whole box of sand falls apart spilling sand everywhere)</p></li>
        <li><p>a fleshlight crowbar, but the hole is on the inside of the bend</p></li>
        <li><p>a crowbar with a bluetooth feature, but it does nothing (you can only connect your phone/device to it... nothing more)</p></li>
        <li><p>a crowbar with an LED inside it (the led is on... you just dont see it...)</p></li>
        <li><p>a crowbar with a keychain, but the keychain ring is inside the crowbar (partially or fully... doesnt matter cuz you cant put anything on it anyway)</p></li>
