    <h1 style="text-align: center"><strong>About Crowbar Gang</strong></h1>
    <p style="text-align: center">
        A long time ago in a galaxy far far away a bunch of retards got really drunk and high (only one person was drunk and another was high the rest were sadly sober)<br><br>
        we were talking about the <a href="https://youtu.be/aFlromB6SnU">Demon Core incident during the Manhattan project</a> where a scientist used a flat head screwdriver to hold the sphere as close to super critical as possible but (as expected) slips and shit happens<br><br>
        because we were all in VRC talking about this<br><br> i pulled out a crowbar that my avatar had and tried to imitate a flat head screwdriver with the bottom part of my crowbar<br><br>
        then <a href="">Sparrow</a> said he will weld a star shaped screwdriver head on the bottom of the crowbar instead of the flat head just for fun<br><br>
        and it was at that point that the useless crowbar idea was born and <a href="useless-crowbar-ideas.html">we started adding more ideas on how to make useless crowbars</a><br><br>
        so thats how we worship useless crowbars now (for those who dont wanna worship <em><strong>useless</strong></em> ones we also accept regular crowbar worshippers)<br><br>
        and thats where the story <em><strong>SHOULD</strong></em> end<br><br>
        but no<br><br>
        theres more<br><br>
        oh boy theres MORE<br><br>
        one of the (sadly)sober people who were at the ''event'' decided to take it a step further<br><br>
        because we mentioned a mascot and the obvious weeb response from me was ''Crowbar-Chan!!!''<br><br>
        <a href="">Karmaki</a> decided to PAY a professional manga artist to make a god damn <a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/canvas/crowbar-chan-is-not-useless/list?title_no=590583"><em><strong>COMIC!!!</strong></em></a> about Crowbar-Chan<br><br>
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <br><br>
    <p style="text-align: left">
        So to sum this up:<br>
        -This is an inside joke taken too far (and we will keep going as far as physically possible)<br>
        -We made a damn <a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/canvas/crowbar-chan-is-not-useless/list?title_no=590583"><em><strong>comic</strong></em></a> about it
