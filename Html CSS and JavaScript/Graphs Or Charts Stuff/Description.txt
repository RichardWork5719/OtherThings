A very simple graph that has some randomly generated values every time the page is reloaded

In a professional work space I would have made a separate CSS file with all the CSS in it
for ease of acces for myself I have put the CSS inside the html

The graph resets after the 3rd update/change
this is a very crude solution to a problem I discovered
I'm in the process of thinking of a solution 
or at this point
already in the process of thinking of a way to implement the solution

update: better version in Graph2.0 folder
